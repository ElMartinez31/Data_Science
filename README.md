This is my sandbox, you can find a lot of data science projets.
You can find several types:
- Tutorials
- Exercices to refresh the knowledge
- Global data science projects
- Projects on specific topics/libraries

Sometimes the output is very verbose, you can open it on colab to reduce it and easily scroll on the different cells.
